DaVinci made detailed drawings of human anatomy, which are still highly regarded today. DaVinci wrote notebook entries in mirror (backwards) script, a trick that kept many of his observations from being widely known until decades after his death. It is believed that he was hiding his scientific ideas from the powerful Roman Catholic church, whose teachings sometimes disagreed with what Leonardo observed.
