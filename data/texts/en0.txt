King Tut's tomb contained four coffins. The third coffin was made from 2,500 pounds of gold. And in today's market is worth approximately $13,000,000. The very first enclosed shopping mall was and is Valley Faire in Appleton, Wisconsin. Not in Minnesota as most people believe. Appleton is also famous for being the birth place of Harry Houdini and the first city in America to use Hydro-electric power in homes.
